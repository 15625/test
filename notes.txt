  Encourage top-down thinking (structural induction)
  Mathematical/Algebra thinking
     say no to confusing notation designed by programmers
  learn quickly, but takes time to perfect
     essentially only letrec
  No fancy UI
  Rely on external editor
  Syntax: format (indentation & space) matters
  encourage carefulness (do not tolerate carelessness)
     example: no tolerance of extra space
  No style cops/ mostly just canonical form allowed
     example: no empty lines  -- reasoning: how many empty lines? "tasteful?"
                                    1 between segments
                                    2 between methods
                                    3 between classes
  simple straightforward rules


  <binding> ::= <var> = <expr>

  <app-expr> ::= <expr> <expr>
  // <expr> { \n+4 <binding> } |
